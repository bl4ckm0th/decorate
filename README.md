# decorate
One of my first projects as a beginner in Python. It's very basic, but I hope you enjoy it. Just type whatever you want and it will be encased in a lovely line of special characters!! Made for Linux terminal. To make it an executable just type go to decorate directory and type    chmod +x decorate.py and type    ./decorate to run.

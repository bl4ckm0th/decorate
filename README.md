# decorate
One of my first projects as a beginner in Python. It's very basic, but I hope you enjoy it. Just type whatever you want and it will be encased in a lovely line of special characters!! Made for Linux terminal.

For running as an executable, do the following:
* Type `cd decorate` to go to the `decorate` ditectory

* Then type `chmod +x decorate.py` to give the script executable permissions.
